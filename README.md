"Create a high-quality CI/CD pipeline flowchart in digital illustration format, suitable for a professional presentation. The pipeline includes the following steps, connected by arrows and labeled clearly. Use the official logos of each tool (e.g., GitLab, Jenkins, Fortify, Black Duck, SonarQube, Docker, Nexus, Java, VM):

1. A developer icon pushing code to GitLab.


2. Jenkins detects a new commit in GitLab.


3. Jenkins pipeline is triggered.


4. Jenkins runs Fortify to generate a security report.


5. Jenkins runs Black Duck to generate an open-source vulnerability report.


6. Jenkins runs SonarQube to generate code quality report.


7. Jenkins compiles Java code and builds Docker images.


8. Jenkins builds ML and UI Docker images.


9. All images are pushed to a private Nexus repository.


10. Once reports and builds are successful, Jenkins deploys the application to a VM (single-node or multi-node Kubernetes cluster).



Ensure all steps are linked properly in order, and each component/tool has its official logo. Use a clean, modern design with professional visual layout for clarity."
